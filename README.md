Trumprogger: An Arcade Game Clone
===============================

## Getting started

First, clone or download the repo to your local machine. Once downloaded, launhc the <em>index.html</em> file in your preferred browser. 

## The Goal

Trump needs to get to safety through a throng of reporters! Can he make it to across the very spare Washington Mall grass? 

## TODO

- Update the Net Worth counter depending on collisions and item pickups.
- Finish the item-drop logic (KFC buckets and bottles of Diet Coke), which help bring Trump's net worth back up.
- Finish the Putin-Lives-Matter counter so each Putin head lost equates to Trump being sent back to his starting position
- Finish closing animation sequence and final audio cuts 
- Finalize modal approach, which will likely be a third-level canvas animation
